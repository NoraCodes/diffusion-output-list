# diffusion-output-list

This is a list of sites that use diffusion output (AI art) from programs like
Midjourney as illustrations, banners, or otherwise as a replacement for
human-created artworks.

Inclusion on this list is not a condemnation of the creators of the websites in
question; rather, it's a way to make it easy for users to get a warning before
potentially viewing and supporting (through ads) people who are undercutting the
labor market using diffusion models as labor-saving devices.

## Importing

Add [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoraCodes/diffusion-output-list/main/diffusion-output-list`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NoraCodes/diffusion-output-list/main/diffusion-output-list) to your ad-blocker's list of subscribed blocklists.

## Inclusion Criteria

1. The site must use diffusion output on a public-facing page.
1. Those images must be used in a way that, hypothetically, replaces human
   artworks. This means that *writing about diffusion models*, with examples, is
   not a valid reason for inclusion on the list.
